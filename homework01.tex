\section{Introduction}

Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) Equations are partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \varphi + U\nabla \cdot \varphi = D\nabla^2\cdot\phi + R(\varphi)\]
That is, they are characterized by the presence of advection: $U\nabla \cdot \varphi$; diffusion: $D\nabla^2 \cdot \varphi$; and arbitrary reaction: $R(\varphi)$.
They encompass a wide range of phenomena including diffusion (for example of heat or fluid), atmospheric transport, various chemical phenomena, bacterial growth, and more. 
Thus it is desirable to simulate their solutions and we do so here.
